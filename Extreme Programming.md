# Extreme Programming (Iteration 3)

## Task & People Involved: 
- The extreme programming task focused around our `Iteration 4` deliverable, in which we are making a word unscrambling minigame as our *2nd* minigame
- **Task 1):** Create a bare bones interface of what Minigame 2 will look like

- **People involved:** `Jaden Johnson & Sarah Yoon`
  - This involves all of the following `Unit tests:`
     - Ensure that the user can input a **String** and have it check with the correct string and see if they match
     - Add a visual so that the user can either drag around or move around blocks with the given characters
     - Create a fully active bridge if the user input the correct word
     - The bridge is broken otherwise
   
- **Task 2):** Finalize and Polish/Finalize Game Logic for Game 1

- **People involved:** `Tanner Platt & Rory Sullivan`
     - This involved all of the following `Unit Tests:`
     - Create a loading screen that let the user know what sum they were trying to match, and be able to navigate through this screen
     - Create game logic so that each of the individual fruit have a different value when they are caught
     - Create win/lose conditions
     - Create a timer to indicate when the dash ability is available again

## Working Tests (Task 1):
- User can input a string and have it compare with an answer string from an array of potential strings
- Art assets are involved meaning that we can have characters on blocks
## Failed Tests (Task 1):
- Creating a bridge in which the user can build the bridge by typing out the string
- Gameplay mechanics to show a bridge either being built or being destroyed due to correct/incorrect answers


## Working Tests (Task 2):
- Game logic is solid and the game now acts as normal
- Clear win/lose conditions
## Failed Tests (Task 2):
- Dash timer was slightly buggy at first, and is now being iterated on
- Changing timer logic so that the game enhances more of the `mental math` instead of just adding with a sum in place
