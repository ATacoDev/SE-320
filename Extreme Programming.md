## Task & People Involved: 
- The extreme programming task focused around our `Iteration 4` deliverable, in which we are making a word unscrambling minigame as our *2nd* minigame
- **People involved: ** `Jaden Johnson & Tanner Platt`
- `Sarah Yoon and Rory Sullivan` were working on art assets
- **Task: ** Create a bare bones interface of what Minigame 2 will look like
  - This involves all of the following `Unit tests:`
     - Ensure that the user can input a **String** and have it check with the correct string and see if they match
     - Add a visual so that the user can either drag around or move around blocks with the given characters
     - Create a fully active bridge if the user input the correct word
     - The bridge is broken otherwise

## Working Tests:
- User can input a string and have it compare with an answer string from an array of potential strings
- Art assets are involved meaning that we can have characters on blocks

## Failed Tests:
- Creating a bridge in which the user can build the bridge by typing out the string
- Gameplay mechanics to show a bridge either being built or being destroyed due to correct/incorrect answers
