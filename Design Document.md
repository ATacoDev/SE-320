# Software Design Documentation

## System Overview
- We are building an educational game for elementary-aged students. There are sub-sections of the game that contain a mini-game per subject. These games are intended to help educate students while creating fun and engaging games. The app will be built using Unity and C#. 


## Design Specifications
- Kid Friendly
- Simple language should be used to accomodate for a younger audience
- Will only be compatable for PC. No current plans for anything mobile or console


## Detailed Design
- Vertical prototyping approach since we are designing with each minigame being its own deliverable
- Iterative approach, as we will be iterating on each deliverable

## Implementation Plan
- Started with a basic menu and scenes as a backbone
- Create basic gameplay loop and art for minigame 1
- Create basic gameplay loop and art for minigame 2, polish minigame 1
- Create basic gameplay loop and art for minigame 3, polish minigame 1 and 2
- Polish all minigames with sound effects and animations

## Conclusion
- Overall, we plan to cater our design to kids, who will be the majority of our users. We are going for a simple design and also will use language that is easy to understand. Each deliverable will build off of each other as we continue.
