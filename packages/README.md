# Packages

## Serves as an area for downloadable packages for each of our deliverables

- When downloading a package, make sure you are in Full HD (1920x1080), also be sure to **add open scenes in build settings**
  
## List of important packages:

### `Iteration3`
Evertyhing that has been worked on up until the submission of Iteration 3

### `Iteration3.2`
- Added functionality for minigame 2 including:
  - Slots now check for what text is being held inside of them
