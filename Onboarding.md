# Welcome to our project!

🎉 Welcome aboard! We're thrilled to have you join our team. This document will guide you through everything you need to know to get started with our project.

## About our project 😊

We are building an educational game for elementary-aged students. There are sub-sections of the game that contain a mini-game per subject. These games are intended to help educate students while being both fun and engaging. The app will be built using Unity and C#, and will currently only run on PC.
